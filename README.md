Yet another (and ugly) debloat suite for Windows 10, i just reverse engineer [WPD close source app](https://wpd.app/) and add some must cool tools for my new windows install. The motivation was I didn't want to use a "close source privacy app" for something simple as changing group policies also others debloat scripts can break the system and they are too aggressive without easy revert changes.
