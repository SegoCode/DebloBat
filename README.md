Yes, i know, here is, another, and ugly, debloat meme script for Windows 10. I reverse-engineered the [WPD closed-source app](https://wpd.app/), [AtlasOS](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas), [Privacy.sexy](https://github.com/undergroundwires/privacy.sexy), and some useful configurations for my new Windows installation. I was motivated to do this because I didn't want to use a closed-source privacy app, aggressive scripts, or modified ISOs for simple tasks like changing Group Policies. Additionally, other debloat scripts can break the system as they are too aggressive in changing risky registry values without providing an easy way to revert the changes and without thorough research on the implications of each configuration.
