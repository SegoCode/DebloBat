Yes, I know... Here is another ugly meme script to debloat Windows, this no longer makes sense... honestly, the other options I found online didn't seem right for me to use on my computer. Many of them involved using outdated settings or just copying and pasting stuff without really knowing what it might do. That's why I decided to create something focused only on Group Policies, which usually don't get outdated. I carefully checked each setting to make sure any changes can be undone easily, so nothing bad happens, and I made sure the script is easy to read and understand. I didn't want to use any private tools, harsh scripts, or Windows iso just for some basic adjustments in Group Policies. Using resources like [admx.help](https://admx.help), [WPD app](https://wpd.app/), [AtlasOS](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas), and Privacy.sexy, I made this deblo.bat file.
