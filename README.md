Yet another (and ugly) debloat meme script for Windows 10, i just reverse engineer [WPD close source app](https://wpd.app/) and add some must cool tools for my new windows install. The motivation was I didn't want to use a "close source privacy app" for something simple as changing Group Policies also others debloat scripts can break the system and they are too aggressive changing risky regisry values without easily revert, Group Policy method is more secure.


## Features
