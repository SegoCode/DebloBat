Yet another (and ugly) debloat meme script for Windows 10, i just reverse engineer [WPD close source app](https://wpd.app/), [AtlasOS](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas), [Privacy.sexy](https://github.com/undergroundwires/privacy.sexy) and some useful configs for my new windows install, being very careful on each registry key. The motivation was I didn't want to use a "close source privacy app" or "agresive scripts" or "modified ISO" for something simple as changing Group Policies, and others debloat scripts can break the system and they are too aggressive changing risky regisry values without easily revert without thoroughly researching what each configuration involves.
