Section 1 – Definitions.

  1. NonCommercial refers to any usage, distribution, or adaptation of the licensed 
     material that is not primarily intended for or directed towards commercial 
     advantage or monetary compensation, unless specific prior explicit and signed 
     written permission is granted by the original author, SegoCode.

  2. Adapted Material refers to any material derived from or based upon the licensed 
     material, in which the licensed material is translated, altered, arranged, 
     transformed, or otherwise modified. This definition excludes exact copies of 
     the material.

  3. ProhibitedPractices include, but are not limited to:
  
       a. Derived or adapted material must clearly acknowledge the original work and the 
          original author, SegoCode, in a place in the documentation or other materials 
          provided with the distribution. This acknowledgment should include a link to the 
          original source code repository.
       b. Distributing the licensed material bundled with unrelated or potentially harmful 
          software, such as adware, malware, or spyware, that may compromise the security, 
          privacy, or user experience of individuals who access or use the material.
       c. Falsely claiming endorsements or associations with the original author, other 
          contributors to the project, or any well-known entity, in an attempt to 
          mislead users or enhance the credibility of the derived or adapted material.

Section 2 – License Conditions.

  1. Redistributions of the licensed material, either in source code or binary form, 
     must retain the above copyright notice, this list of conditions, the following 
     disclaimer, and the definitions in Section 1. When redistributing in binary 
     form, these elements must be included in the documentation and/or other 
     materials provided with the distribution.

  2. Redistribution and use of the material, in source or binary forms, are allowed 
     for NonCommercial purposes only. The creation, reproduction, and sharing of adapted 
     material are also permitted for NonCommercial purposes, provided that no 
     ProhibitedPractices are involved in any case.

  3. Redistribution of Adapted Material must be available in a publicly accessible 
     compressed or archival form, which includes the source code of the Adapted 
     Material, all modules it contains, any associated interface definition files, 
     scripts used to control compilation and installation of executable code, and 
     the appropriate decompression or de-archiving software widely available for 
     no charge. Redistribution should be free of charge unless otherwise agreed upon 
     with the original author, SegoCode.

  4. If you allow users to interact with the Adapted Material remotely via a computer 
     network, you must provide the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for 
     the version they are using. This source code must be provided under the same terms and 
     conditions outlined in this license, and through a publicly accessible repository, a 
     downloadable archive, or other readily accessible means. This requirement applies even 
     if you run the Adapted Material on a server and users interact with it remotely through 
     a network.

  5. It is encouraged to acknowledge the original author of the initial 
     work of the project, SegoCode, when using the licensed material or related works/services 
     in any derivative or adapted work. However, if an agreement is reached with the 
     original author, SegoCode, the acknowledgment requirement may be waived or 
     adjusted according to the terms of the agreement.

Section 3 – Updates and Revisions.

  1. SegoCode reserves the right to revise, update, or change this license at any time, 
     without any obligation to provide prior notice or notification to users.

  2. Continued use of the licensed material following any changes to the license constitutes 
     acceptance of those changes. It is the user's responsibility to regularly review the 
     license terms and ensure compliance with its current version.
