Section 1 – Definitions.

  1. NonCommercial refers to any usage, distribution, or adaptation of the licensed 
     material that is not primarily intended for or directed towards commercial 
     advantage or monetary compensation, unless specific prior explicit and signed 
     written permission is granted by the original author, SegoCode.

  2. InappropriatePractices include, but are not limited to:
       2.a. Duplication or replication of the material with minor 
            alterations such as changing the name, while still claiming it as a 
            distinct work.
       2.b. Distributing the licensed material bundled with unrelated or potentially harmful 
            software, such as adware, malware, or spyware, that may compromise the security, 
            privacy, or user experience of individuals who access or use the material.
       2.c. Falsely claiming endorsements or associations with the original author, other 
            contributors to the project, or any well-known entity, in an attempt to 
            mislead users or enhance the credibility of the derived or adapted material.
       2.d. It is encouraged to acknowledge the original author of the initial 
            work of the project, SegoCode, when using the licensed material or related works/services 
            in any derivative or adapted work. However, if an agreement is reached with the 
            original author, SegoCode, the acknowledgment requirement may be waived or 
            adjusted according to the terms of the agreement.
  
  3. Adapted Material refers to any material derived from or based upon the licensed 
     material, in which the licensed material is translated, altered, arranged, 
     transformed, or otherwise modified. This definition excludes exact copies of 
     the material.
